# 328. Odd Even Linked List `Medium`

- **Origin Link**: [https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/](https://leetcode.com/problems/odd-even-linked-list/)
- **Tag**: `Linked List`

## Description

Given the `head` of a singly linked list, group all the nodes with odd indices together followed by the nodes with even indices, and return *the reordered list*.

The **first** node is considered **odd**, and the **second** node is **even**, and so on.

Note that the relative order inside both the even and odd groups should remain as it was in the input.

You must solve the problem in `O(1)` extra space complexity and `O(n)` time complexity.


## Example

**Example 1:**

![](./oddeven-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: [1,3,5,2,4]
```

**Example 2:**

![](./oddeven2-linked-list.jpg)

```
Input: head = [2,1,3,5,6,4,7]
Output: [2,3,6,7,1,5,4]
```


## Constraints

- `n == `number of nodes in the linked list
- `0 <= n <= 10^4`
- `-10^6 <= Node.val <= 10^6`


## Solution Template

```java
/**
 * Definition for singly-linked list.
 * public class ListNode {
 *     int val;
 *     ListNode next;
 *     ListNode() {}
 *     ListNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     ListNode(int val, ListNode next) { this.val = val; this.next = next; }
 * }
 */
class Solution {
    public ListNode oddEvenList(ListNode head) {

    }
}
```
