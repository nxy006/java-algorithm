- **Origin Link**: [https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/](https://leetcode.com/problems/reverse-string/)
- **Tag**: `Two Pointers`, `String`, `Recursion`

## Description

Write a function that reverses a string. The input string is given as an array of characters `s`.

You must do this by modifying the input array [in-place](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) with `O(1)` extra memory.


## Example

**Example 1:**

```
Input: s = ["h","e","l","l","o"]
Output: ["o","l","l","e","h"]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: s = ["H","a","n","n","a","h"]
Output: ["h","a","n","n","a","H"]
```


## Constraints

- `1 <= s.length <= 105`
- `s[i]` is a [printable ascii character](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII#Printable_characters).


## Solution Template

```java
class Solution {
    public void reverseString(char[] s) {

    }
}
```
