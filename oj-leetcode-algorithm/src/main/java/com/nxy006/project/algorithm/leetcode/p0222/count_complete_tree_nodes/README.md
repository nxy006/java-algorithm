# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes `Medium`

- **Origin Link**: [https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/](https://leetcode.com/problems/count-complete-tree-nodes/)
- **Tag**: `Binary Search`, `Tree`, `Depth-First Search`, `Binary Tree`

## Description

Given the `root` of a **complete** binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to **[Wikipedia](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree#Types_of_binary_trees)**, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between `1` and `2^h` nodes inclusive at the last level `h`.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than `O(n)` time complexity.


## Example

**Example 1:**

![](./complete.jpg)

```
Input: root = [1,2,3,4,5,6]
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: root = []
Output: 0
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: root = [1]
Output: 1
```


## Constraints

- The number of nodes in the tree is in the range `[0, 5 * 10^4]`.
- `0 <= Node.val <= 5 * 10^4`
- The tree is guaranteed to be **complete**.


## Solution Template

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

class Solution {
    public int countNodes(TreeNode root) {

    }
}
```
