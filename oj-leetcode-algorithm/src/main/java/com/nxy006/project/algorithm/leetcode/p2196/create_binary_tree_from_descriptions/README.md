# 2196. Create Binary Tree From Descriptions `Medium`

- **Origin Link**: [https://leetcode.com/problems/create-binary-tree-from-descriptions/](https://leetcode.com/problems/create-binary-tree-from-descriptions/)
- **Tag**: (Empty)


## Description

You are given a 2D integer array `descriptions` where `descriptions[i] = [parenti, childi, isLefti]` indicates that `parenti` is the **parent** of `childi` in a **binary** tree of **unique** values. Furthermore,

- If `isLefti == 1`, then `childi` is the left child of `parenti`.
- If `isLefti == 0`, then `childi` is the right child of `parenti`.

Construct the binary tree described by `descriptions` and return *its **root***.

The test cases will be generated such that the binary tree is **valid**.


## Example

**Example 1:**

![](./example1drawio.png)

```
Input: descriptions = [[20,15,1],[20,17,0],[50,20,1],[50,80,0],[80,19,1]]
Output: [50,20,80,15,17,19]
Explanation: The root node is the node with value 50 since it has no parent.
The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.
```

**Example 2:**

![](./example2drawio.png)

```
Input: descriptions = [[1,2,1],[2,3,0],[3,4,1]]
Output: [1,2,null,null,3,4]
Explanation: The root node is the node with value 1 since it has no parent.
The resulting binary tree is shown in the diagram.
```


## Constraints

- `1 <= descriptions.length <= 104`
- `descriptions[i].length == 3`
- `1 <= parent_i, child_i <= 105`
- `0 <= isLeft_i <= 1`
- The binary tree described by `descriptions` is valid.


## Solution Template

```java
/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * public class TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode left;
 *     TreeNode right;
 *     TreeNode() {}
 *     TreeNode(int val) { this.val = val; }
 *     TreeNode(int val, TreeNode left, TreeNode right) {
 *         this.val = val;
 *         this.left = left;
 *         this.right = right;
 *     }
 * }

    public TreeNode createBinaryTree(int[][] descriptions) {
